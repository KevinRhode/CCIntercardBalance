# Intercard Card Balance Check

## Description

This program was created to quickly check Intercard Cards Balances with the Intercard API. I bulit this program for our satellite locations that do not have our 
card system to have the ablitily to check balances without calling the main location or remoteing into one of the servers. This program solves the issue
of quickly checking cards for customers at our many locations. I learned a better understanding of the Intercard API offered and some of its other abilities.

* Points are the amount of tickets that are redeemable on the card.
* Redeemable Cash is labeled and bonus cash is only usable at the GR location (where it was purchased)

* On the bottom are 3 packages that we offer at Craigs that is redeemable at other locations, 1, 2, or 3 Attractions.
